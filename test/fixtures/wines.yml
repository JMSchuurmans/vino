  price: "$9"

  vintage: "2015"
  origin: "Columbia Valley, Washington"
  price: "$13"
  rating: 9
  tasting_notes: "Bold, rich and textured but not over the top â€“ it remains wonderfully restrained and focused. Aromas of black cherry, blackberry, and earthy, savory notes of tobacco and herbs, vanilla, and cocoa. A full mouthfeel with a long and supple finish. It's an intense dark blue / purple in color with tremendous purity, depth, and focus. Tannins are elegant, and refined."
